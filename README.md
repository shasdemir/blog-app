blog-app
========

This is a simple blog application I made for Udacity's Web Development course.

The first commit passes the Lesson 6 exam. Others add extra features or improvements, but may not necessarily pass the exam.

**Note:** security_core.py was only for me to learn about account security. It is not suitable for use in actual projects.
